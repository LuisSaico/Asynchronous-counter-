This is an academic project developed using Digital Works.
This circuit simulator have asynchronous counter (Flip-Flops J-K), so the principal function is try to resolve a formula with some conditions:
1. It need to resolve the formula " f(x) = x2- 3x + 3" increasing 7 times "x = [0,7]".
2. It need to print the result of the fomula in each formula.
3. Whe it is in the last iteration (7), it will reset the circuit.
